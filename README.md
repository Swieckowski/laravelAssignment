Simple code assignment for AbleTo

>Think of this exercise as if someone goes through a set of questions day after day that he/she needs to answer and then sees the results. Once users log in, have them answer a set of "behavioral" questions (how they feel, what they did today, what they had for breakfast - 3-4 questions is fine) and then please display their answers.

This requirement is met by the questionnaire view, where a user gets all available questions. There, once a user answers a question, it's added to the answered list.
Both answered and unanswered questions are in this view, and a user can choose to to edit their answers if they please.

>The answers to the questions should be multiple-choice / structured format (not free form where you can type in your answer). This way you can build a report or some dashboard around answer's history.

This requirement is met in that answers are in multiple choice format, however I regretfully misunderstood this as only a structure requirement as a foundation for future features.
Therefore, if this requirement necessitated that I create a view of all the questionnaires where a user answered in a specific way, this was not fully met.
Though, with 

>For example, the question could be asked "what did you eat today for breakfast ?" with answers "eggs, cereal, toast" and you could select a different answer each "day" (for the purposes of this exercise a concept of each "day" could mean each "try" ). 

This requirement is 

The exercise doesn't have to have many models or controllers -  what's important is that the code is tested / documented / we can run it (so dependencies are clearly defined and well explained).
